[Original prompt can be found here.]()

PREVIEW:



## How to Play
Using the left and right keys to move and the spacebar to jump, navigate around the enemies for three levels.
You can get rid of an enemy by jumping on top them. If you touch an enemy in any other way, you lose a life. 
You can also lose a life by falling into a gap in the lowest floor. After three lives lost, you lose the game. 
Otherwise, if you manage to survive all three levels without losing all of your lives, you won the game!
