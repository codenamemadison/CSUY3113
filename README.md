# CSUY3113 - Intro to Game Programming
In this class, we learned how to create simple 2D games in C++ utilizing SDL and OpenGL as well as learned about vectors, coordinate systems, sprites, collisions, physics, audio, and handling input. More about the material covered can be found [here](https://github.com/carmineguida/CS3113/blob/master/Syllabus.pdf). Below is the list of projects I worked on:
