## How to Play

Use the space bar to start moving the ball. 
Player One (left side) uses W and S keys to move the paddle up and down.
Player Two (right side) uses the Up and Down keys to move the paddle like so.

Once someone fails to hit the ball back and the ball collides into the wall, the ball stops and the game is over!
