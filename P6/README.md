## Project Aim
Created a top down 2D game. The user must play a character trapped in the sewers of a fictional world and get out 
without losing all three lives to enemies. 
The game consists of a menu screen, two minutes of gameplay, moving AI, music, and sound/effects.

PREVIEW:



## How to Play
After waking up in the sewers of a mysterious fictional world filled with all sorts of monsters, you want to get out as soon as you can 
without dying. Use the up, down, left, and right keys to move your character accordingly and avoid enemies at all costs! 

In each level, surviving isn't enough. You must collect a key to unlock the door to the next level (where would it be though? 
That's for you to figure out!)
