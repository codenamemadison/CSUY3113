## Project Aim
 Creating our own version of Lunar Lander, where the user can control a ship that is flying through space. Implemented simulated gravity, acceleration, and collision detection. [Original prompt can be found here.](https://github.com/carmineguida/CS3113/blob/master/Projects/Project%203%20-%20Lunar%20Lander.pdf)

PREVIEW:



## How to Play
Using the left and right keys to move the ship left and right, get to the designated platform to win the game without colliding into wall or rock.
If the ship touches a wall or rock, the game is over.

Note that moving in these directions using the keys causes the acceleration to change of the ship, not velocity.
